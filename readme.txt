Provides comprehensive annotation tools for WordPress posts.

== Description ==

Annie provides comprehensive annotation options, including footnotes and highlighting. If Tippy is installed, footnotes can be displayed inline using tooltips. Also, footnotes are placed at the end of the post. For highlighting, you are able to use default highlighting styles or define your own.

== Installation ==

Upload the plugin into your wp-content/plugins directory
Activate the plugin through the dashboard
Visit the Annie Options page under the Settings section of your dashboard.

To customize the styles, copy the contents of wp-content/plugins/annie/annie.css to your own theme's stylesheet and add .annie_custom to each rule you want to customize. For example:
.annie_notes.annie_custom { etc }

To use Annie:
[hi]text[/hi] to highlight text using your default highlighting style
[hi style="red"]text[/hi] to highlight using the "red" style

[foot]This is my footnote text[/foot] to add a footnote wherever desired.

If you want to manually specify where your footnotes should display, use the [footnotes] shortcode. 

To define new highlighter styles, simply add a rule to your stylesheet following the naming pattern: annie_hilight_yourstyle. To create a new style called "green_italics" define it as:
.annie_hilight_green_italics {
	background-color: green;
	font-style: italics;
}
